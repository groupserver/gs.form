:mod:`gs.form` Documentation
============================

This package provides a useful way of pushing data to a server by
making a ``POST`` to a form. While originally written for
GroupServer_, there is nothing specific to GroupServer in this
product. Mostly it is a light facade around the :mod:`requests`
library, which you should use <http://requests.readthedocs.org>.
